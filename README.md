Nao walking and doing it like Usian Bolt

Demo : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XJL8eZux6lo

This is how Nao should be celebrating his goals during the RoboCup :)

How to make it work ?
---------------------
Just replace the two files from the initial configuration of Simspark in the rcssagent3d folder (http://simspark.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/Installation_on_Linux) with the two files from this repository.
Compile the new agent and run the simulation, you should be able to see the result.

This was made during a small school project, don't hesitate to test it, use it, play with it, change it, share it and do-what-you-want-with it ;)
I will be really interested to see the result if you change it, so just keep me in touch please.
